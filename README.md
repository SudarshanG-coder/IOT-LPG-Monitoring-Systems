## 📷 System Overview

This project presents a smart IoT-based system that improves **household LPG safety** by combining real-time monitoring, fire/leak detection, and automation. The device:

- **Detects LPG gas leakage** and fire using MQ-6 & flame sensors  
- **Monitors gas levels** via load cell and HX711  
- **Auto-books a cylinder refill** when the gas falls below 20%  
- **Sends real-time SMS alerts** using GSM SIM800L  
- **Displays status** on a 16x2 LCD and a web dashboard (ThingSpeak)

> 💡 Designed for domestic safety, smart kitchens, restaurants, and industrial gas monitoring.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Automatic Gas Booking** based on cylinder weight
- 🔥 **Fire and Leak Detection** via sensors
- 📱 **GSM-Based SMS Alerts** to user and agency
- 📊 **Real-time Data Display** on LCD and cloud dashboard
- 🔋 **Low-Power Embedded Design**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Load cell constantly measures the LPG weight
2. If gas < 20% → SMS alert + automatic refill request
3. MQ6 detects gas leakage → triggers buzzer, LCD warning, SMS
4. Flame sensor detects fire → activates alert system
5. Real-time values displayed on LCD and updated to ThingSpeak
